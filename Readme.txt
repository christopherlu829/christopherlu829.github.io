Hello, my name is Christopher Lu I hope you enjoy my website! As stated in the homepage, I am a biomedical engineer, aspiring pharmaceutical scientist, and a photographer in my free time. I plan on adding more of my journey to my personal website in the future as I continue to learn more knowledge, gain more experiences, and take more photos!
